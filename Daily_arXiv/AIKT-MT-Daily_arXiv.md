Title: [Neural Cross-Lingual Relation Extraction Based on Bilingual Word Embedding Mapping]( https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00069 )

> Relation extraction (RE) seeks to detect and classify semantic relationships between entities, which provides useful information for many NLP applications. Since the state-of-the-art RE models require large amounts of manually annotated data and language-specific resources to achieve high accuracy, it is very challenging to transfer an RE model of a resource-rich language to a resource-poor language. In this paper, we propose a new approach for cross-lingual RE model transfer based on bilingual word embedding mapping. It projects word embeddings from a target language to a source language, so that a well-trained source-language neural network RE model can be directly applied to the target language. Experiment results show that the proposed approach achieves very good performance for a number of target languages on both in-house and open datasets, using a small bilingual dictionary with only 1K word pairs.

> The dominant approach to sequence generation is to produce a sequence in some predefined order, e.g. left to right. In contrast, we propose a more general model that can generate the output sequence by inserting tokens in any arbitrary order. Our model learns decoding order as a result of its training procedure. Our experiments show that this model is superior to fixed order models on a number of sequence generation tasks, such as Machine Translation, Image-to-LaTeX and Image Captioning.

> Despite the recent success of deep neural networks in natural language processing (NLP), their interpretability remains a challenge. We analyze the representations learned by neural machine translation models at various levels of granularity and evaluate their quality through relevant extrinsic properties. In particular, we seek answers to the following questions: (i) How accurately is word-structure captured within the learned representations, an important aspect in translating morphologically-rich languages? (ii) Do the representations capture long-range dependencies, and effectively handle syntactically divergent languages? (iii) Do the representations capture lexical semantics? We conduct a thorough investigation along several parameters: (i) Which layers in the architecture capture each of these linguistic phenomena; (ii) How does the choice of translation unit (word, character, or subword unit) impact the linguistic properties captured by the underlying representations? (iii) Do the encoder and decoder learn differently and independently? (iv) Do the representations learned by multilingual NMT models capture the same amount of linguistic information as their bilingual counterparts? Our data-driven, quantitative evaluation illuminates important aspects in NMT models and their ability to capture various linguistic phenomena. We show that deep NMT models learn a non-trivial amount of linguistic information. Notable findings include: i) Word morphology and part-of-speech information are captured at the lower layers of the model; (ii) In contrast, lexical semantics or non-local syntactic and semantic dependencies are better represented at the higher layers; (iii) Representations learned using characters are more informed about wordmorphology compared to those learned using subword units; and (iv) Representations learned by multilingual models are richer compared to bilingual models.

> Most neural machine translation systems still translate sentences in isolation. To make further progress, a promising line of research additionally considers the surrounding context in order to provide the model potentially missing source-side information, as well as to maintain a coherent output. One difficulty in training such larger-context (i.e. document-level) machine translation systems is that context may be missing from many parallel examples. To circumvent this issue, two-stage approaches, in which sentence-level translations are post-edited in context, have recently been proposed. In this paper, we instead consider the viability of filling in the missing context. In particular, we consider three distinct approaches to generate the missing context: using random contexts, applying a copy heuristic or generating it with a language model. In particular, the copy heuristic significantly helps with lexical coherence, while using completely random contexts hurts performance on many long-distance linguistic phenomena. We also validate the usefulness of tagged back-translation. In addition to improving BLEU scores as expected, using back-translated data helps larger-context machine translation systems to better capture long-range phenomena.

> Standard neural machine translation (NMT) is on the assumption of document-level context independent. Most existing document-level NMT methods only focus on briefly introducing document-level information but fail to concern about selecting the most related part inside document context. The capacity of memory network for detecting the most relevant part of the current sentence from the memory provides a natural solution for the requirement of modeling document-level context by document-level NMT. In this work, we propose a Transformer NMT system with associated memory network (AMN) to both capture the document-level context and select the most salient part related to the concerned translation from the memory. Experiments on several tasks show that the proposed method significantly improves the NMT performance over strong Transformer baselines and other related studies.

> Recently, neural models led to significant improvements in both machine translation (MT) and natural language generation tasks (NLG). However, generation of long descriptive summaries conditioned on structured data remains an open challenge. Likewise, MT that goes beyond sentence-level context is still an open issue (e.g., document-level MT or MT with metadata). To address these challenges, we propose to leverage data from both tasks and do transfer learning between MT, NLG, and MT with source-side metadata (MT+NLG). First, we train document-based MT systems with large amounts of parallel data. Then, we adapt these models to pure NLG and MT+NLG tasks by fine-tuning with smaller amounts of domain-specific data. This end-to-end NLG approach, without data selection and planning, outperforms the previous state of the art on the Rotowire NLG task. We participated to the "Document Generation and Translation" task at WNGT 2019, and ranked first in all tracks.

> We share a French-English parallel corpus of Foursquare restaurant reviews ([this https URL](https://europe.naverlabs.com/research/natural-language-processing/machine-translation-of-restaurant-reviews)), and define a new task to encourage research on Neural Machine Translation robustness and domain adaptation, in a real-world scenario where better-quality MT would be greatly beneficial. We discuss the challenges of such user-generated content, and train good baseline models that build upon the latest techniques for MT robustness. We also perform an extensive evaluation (automatic and human) that shows significant improvements over existing online systems. Finally, we propose task-specific metrics based on sentiment analysis or translation accuracy of domain-specific polysemous words.

> We introduce a new large-scale NLI benchmark dataset, collected via an iterative, adversarial human-and-model-in-the-loop procedure. We show that training models on this new dataset leads to state-of-the-art performance on a variety of popular NLI benchmarks, while posing a more difficult challenge with its new test set. Our analysis sheds light on the shortcomings of current state-of-the-art models, and shows that non-expert annotators are successful at finding their weaknesses. The data collection method can be applied in a never-ending learning scenario, becoming a moving target for NLU, rather than a static benchmark that will quickly saturate.
