Title: [Data Augmentation and Terminology Integration for Domain-Specific Sinhala-English-Tamil Statistical Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02821)

> Out of vocabulary (OOV) is a problem in the context of Machine Translation (MT) in low-resourced languages. When source and/or target languages are morphologically rich, it becomes even worse. Bilingual list integration is an approach to address the OOV problem. This allows more words to be translated than are in the training data. However, since bilingual lists contain words in the base form, it will not translate inflected forms for morphologically rich languages such as Sinhala and Tamil. This paper focuses on data augmentation techniques where bilingual lexicon terms are expanded based on case-markers with the objective of generating new words, to be used in Statistical machine Translation (SMT). This data augmentation technique for dictionary terms shows improved BLEU scores for Sinhala-English SMT.

> Simultaneous text translation and end-to-end speech translation have recently made great progress but little work has combined these tasks together. We investigate how to adapt simultaneous text translation methods such as wait-k and monotonic multihead attention to end-to-end simultaneous speech translation by introducing a pre-decision module. A detailed analysis is provided on the latency-quality trade-offs of combining fixed and flexible pre-decision with fixed and flexible policies. We also design a novel computation-aware latency metric, adapted from Average Lagging.

> We probe the layers in multilingual BERT (mBERT) for phylogenetic and geographic language signals across 100 languages and compute language distances based on the mBERT representations. We 1) employ the language distances to infer and evaluate language trees, finding that they are close to the reference family tree in terms of quartet tree distance, 2) perform distance matrix regression analysis, finding that the language distances can be best explained by phylogenetic and worst by structural factors and 3) present a novel measure for measuring diachronic meaning stability (based on cross-lingual representation variability) which correlates significantly with published ranked lists based on linguistic approaches. Our results contribute to the nascent field of typological interpretability of cross-lingual text representations.

> In recent years, pre-trained models have been extensively studied, and several downstream tasks have benefited from their utilization. In this study, we verify the effectiveness of two methods that incorporate a BERT-based pre-trained model developed by Cui et al. (2020) into an encoder-decoder model on Chinese grammatical error correction tasks. We also analyze the error type and conclude that sentence-level errors are yet to be addressed.

> Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has shown drastic improvement in its quality when translating clean input, such as text from the news domain. However, existing studies suggest that NMT still struggles with certain kinds of input with considerable noise, such as User-Generated Contents (UGC) on the Internet. To make better use of NMT for cross-cultural communication, one of the most promising directions is to develop a model that correctly handles these expressions. Though its importance has been recognized, it is still not clear as to what creates the great gap in performance between the translation of clean input and that of UGC. To answer the question, we present a new dataset, PheMT, for evaluating the robustness of MT systems against specific linguistic phenomena in Japanese-English translation. Our experiments with the created dataset revealed that not only our in-house models but even widely used off-the-shelf systems are greatly disturbed by the presence of certain phenomena.

> Language pairs with limited amounts of parallel data, also known as low-resource languages, remain a challenge for neural machine translation. While the Transformer model has achieved significant improvements for many language pairs and has become the de facto mainstream architecture, its capability under low-resource conditions has not been fully investigated yet. Our experiments on different subsets of the IWSLT14 training data show that the effectiveness of Transformer under low-resource conditions is highly dependent on the hyper-parameter settings. Our experiments show that using an optimized Transformer for low-resource conditions improves the translation quality up to 7.3 BLEU points compared to using the Transformer default settings.

> Traditional neural machine translation is limited to the topmost encoder layer's context representation and cannot directly perceive the lower encoder layers. Existing solutions usually rely on the adjustment of network architecture, making the calculation more complicated or introducing additional structural restrictions. In this work, we propose layer-wise multi-view learning to solve this problem, circumventing the necessity to change the model structure. We regard each encoder layer's off-the-shelf output, a by-product in layer-by-layer encoding, as the redundant view for the input sentence. In this way, in addition to the topmost encoder layer (referred to as the primary view), we also incorporate an intermediate encoder layer as the auxiliary view. We feed the two views to a partially shared decoder to maintain independent prediction. Consistency regularization based on KL divergence is used to encourage the two views to learn from each other. Extensive experimental results on five translation tasks show that our approach yields stable improvements over multiple strong baselines. As another bonus, our method is agnostic to network architectures and can maintain the same inference speed as the original model.

Title: [CharBERT: Character-aware Pre-trained Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01513)

> Most pre-trained language models (PLMs) construct word representations at subword level with Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or its variations, by which OOV (out-of-vocab) words are almost avoidable. However, those methods split a word into subword units and make the representation incomplete and fragile. In this paper, we propose a character-aware pre-trained language model named CharBERT improving on the previous methods (such as BERT, RoBERTa) to tackle these problems. We first construct the contextual word embedding for each token from the sequential character representations, then fuse the representations of characters and the subword representations by a novel heterogeneous interaction module. We also propose a new pre-training task named NLM (Noisy LM) for unsupervised character representation learning. We evaluate our method on question answering, sequence labeling, and text classification tasks, both on the original datasets and adversarial misspelling test sets. The experimental results show that our method can significantly improve the performance and robustness of PLMs simultaneously.

> Recent years have seen big advances in the field of sentence-level quality estimation (QE), largely as a result of using neural-based architectures. However, the majority of these methods work only on the language pair they are trained on and need retraining for new language pairs. This process can prove difficult from a technical point of view and is usually computationally expensive. In this paper we propose a simple QE framework based on cross-lingual transformers, and we use it to implement and evaluate two different neural architectures. Our evaluation shows that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results outperforming current open-source quality estimation frameworks when trained on datasets from WMT. In addition, the framework proves very useful in transfer learning settings, especially when dealing with low-resourced languages, allowing us to obtain very competitive results.

> We explore the transferability of a multilingual neural machine translation model to unseen languages when the transfer is grounded solely on the cross-lingual word embeddings. Our experimental results show that the translation knowledge can transfer weakly to other languages and that the degree of transferability depends on the languages' relatedness. We also discuss the limiting aspects of the multilingual architectures that cause weak translation transfer and suggest how to mitigate the limitations.

Title: [Subword Segmentation and a Single Bridge Language Affect Zero-Shot Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01703)

> Zero-shot neural machine translation is an attractive goal because of the high cost of obtaining data and building translation systems for new translation directions. However, previous papers have reported mixed success in zero-shot translation. It is hard to predict in which settings it will be effective, and what limits performance compared to a fully supervised system. In this paper, we investigate zero-shot performance of a multilingual ENâ†”{FR,CS,DE,FI} system trained on WMT data. We find that zero-shot performance is highly unstable and can vary by more than 6 BLEU between training runs, making it difficult to reliably track improvements. We observe a bias towards copying the source in zero-shot translation, and investigate how the choice of subword segmentation affects this bias. We find that language-specific subword segmentation results in less subword copying at training time, and leads to better zero-shot performance compared to jointly trained segmentation. A recent trend in multilingual models is to not train on parallel data between all language pairs, but have a single bridge language, e.g. English. We find that this negatively affects zero-shot translation and leads to a failure mode where the model ignores the language tag and instead produces English output in zero-shot directions. We show that this bias towards English can be effectively reduced with even a small amount of parallel data in some of the non-English pairs.

> Many real-world video-text tasks involve different levels of granularity, such as frames and words, clip and sentences or videos and paragraphs, each with distinct semantics. In this paper, we propose a Cooperative hierarchical Transformer (COOT) to leverage this hierarchy information and model the interactions between different levels of granularity and different modalities. The method consists of three major components: an attention-aware feature aggregation layer, which leverages the local temporal context (intra-level, e.g., within a clip), a contextual transformer to learn the interactions between low-level and high-level semantics (inter-level, e.g. clip-video, sentence-paragraph), and a cross-modal cycle-consistency loss to connect video and text. The resulting method compares favorably to the state of the art on several benchmarks while having few parameters.

Authors: [Steven Weber](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Weber%2C+S)

> This paper explores the hypothesis that the diversity of human languages, right now a barrier to interoperability in communication and trade, will become significantly less of a barrier as machine translation technologies are deployed over the next several years.But this new boundary-breaking technology does not reduce all boundaries equally, and it creates new challenges for the distribution of ideas and thus for innovation and economic growth.

> Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on speech translation tasks. However, the model architecture is not efficient enough for streaming scenarios since self-attention is computed over an entire input sequence and the computational cost grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence. Nevertheless, most of the previous work on simultaneous speech translation, the task of generating translations from partial audio input, ignores the time spent in generating the translation when analyzing the latency. With this assumption, a system may have good latency quality trade-offs but be inapplicable in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the task of streaming simultaneous speech translation, where the systems are not only capable of translating with partial input but are also able to handle very long or continuous input. We propose an end-to-end transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model, equipped with an augmented memory transformer encoder, which has shown great success on the streaming automatic speech recognition task with hybrid or transducer-based models. We conduct an empirical evaluation of the proposed model on segment, context and memory sizes and we compare our approach to a transformer with a unidirectional mask.

> Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in learning representations of audio that are useful for automatic speech recognition (ASR). But, training SSL models like wav2vec~2.0 requires a two-stage pipeline. In this paper we demonstrate a single-stage training of ASR models that can utilize both unlabeled and labeled data. During training, we alternately minimize two losses: an unsupervised masked Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) loss and the supervised audio-to-text alignment loss Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). We show that this joint training method directly optimizes performance for the downstream ASR task using unsupervised data while achieving similar word error rates to wav2vec~2.0 on the Librispeech 100-hour dataset. Finally, we postulate that solving the contrastive task is a regularization for the supervised CTC loss.

Title: [Evaluating Bias In Dutch Word Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00244)

> Recent research in Natural Language Processing has revealed that word embeddings can encode social biases present in the training data which can affect minorities in real world applications. This paper explores the gender bias implicit in Dutch embeddings while investigating whether English language based approaches can also be used in Dutch. We implement the Word Embeddings Association Test (WEAT), Clustering and Sentence Embeddings Association Test (SEAT) methods to quantify the gender bias in Dutch word embeddings, then we proceed to reduce the bias with Hard-Debias and Sent-Debias mitigation methods and finally we evaluate the performance of the debiased embeddings in downstream tasks. The results suggest that, among others, gender bias is present in traditional and contextualized Dutch word embeddings. We highlight how techniques used to measure and reduce bias created for English can be used in Dutch embeddings by adequately translating the data and taking into account the unique characteristics of the language. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of the debiasing techniques on downstream tasks which show a negligible impact on traditional embeddings and a 2% decrease in performance in contextualized embeddings. Finally, we release the translated Dutch datasets to the public along with the traditional embeddings with mitigated bias.

> As modern neural machine translation (NMT) systems have been widely deployed, their security vulnerabilities require close scrutiny. Most recently, NMT systems have been shown to be vulnerable to targeted attacks which cause them to produce specific, unsolicited, and even harmful translations. These attacks are usually exploited in a white-box setting, where adversarial inputs causing targeted translations are discovered for a known target system. However, this approach is less useful when the target system is black-box and unknown to the adversary (e.g., secured commercial systems). In this paper, we show that targeted attacks on black-box NMT systems are feasible, based on poisoning a small fraction of their parallel training data. We demonstrate that this attack can be realised practically via targeted corruption of web documents crawled to form the system's training data. We then analyse the effectiveness of the targeted poisoning in two common NMT training scenarios, which are the one-off training and pre-train & fine-tune paradigms. Our results are alarming: even on the state-of-the-art systems trained with massive parallel data (tens of millions), the attacks are still successful (over 50% success rate) under surprisingly low poisoning rates (e.g., 0.006%). Lastly, we discuss potential defences to counter such attacks.

Title: [Investigating Catastrophic Forgetting During Continual Training for Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00678)

Authors: [Shuhao Gu](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Gu%2C+S), [Yang Feng](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Feng%2C+Y)

> Neural machine translation (NMT) models usually suffer from catastrophic forgetting during continual training where the models tend to gradually forget previously learned knowledge and swing to fit the newly added data which may have a different distribution, e.g. a different domain. Although many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, we cannot get to know what causes this phenomenon yet. Under the background of domain adaptation, we investigate the cause of catastrophic forgetting from the perspectives of modules and parameters (neurons). The investigation on the modules of the NMT model shows that some modules have tight relation with the general-domain knowledge while some other modules are more essential in the domain adaptation. And the investigation on the parameters shows that some parameters are important for both the general-domain and in-domain translation and the great change of them during continual training brings about the performance decline in general-domain. We conduct experiments across different language pairs and domains to ensure the validity and reliability of our findings.

> We introduce dual-decoder Transformer, a new model architecture that jointly performs automatic speech recognition (ASR) and multilingual speech translation (ST). Our models are based on the original Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) but consist of two decoders, each responsible for one task (ASR or ST). Our major contribution lies in how these decoders interact with each other: one decoder can attend to different information sources from the other via a dual-attention mechanism. We propose two variants of these architectures corresponding to two different levels of dependencies between the decoders, called the parallel and cross dual-decoder Transformers, respectively. Extensive experiments on the MuST-C dataset show that our models outperform the previously-reported highest translation performance in the multilingual settings, and outperform as well bilingual one-to-one results. Furthermore, our parallel models demonstrate no trade-off between ASR and ST compared to the vanilla multi-task architecture. Our code and pre-trained models are available at [this https URL](https://github.com/formiel/speech-translation).

> Non-autoregressive translation (NAT) significantly accelerates the inference process by predicting the entire target sequence. However, due to the lack of target dependency modelling in the decoder, the conditional generation process heavily depends on the cross-attention. In this paper, we reveal a localness perception problem in NAT cross-attention, for which it is difficult to adequately capture source context. To alleviate this problem, we propose to enhance signals of neighbour source tokens into conventional cross-attention. Experimental results on several representative datasets show that our approach can consistently improve translation quality over strong NAT baselines. Extensive analyses demonstrate that the enhanced cross-attention achieves better exploitation of source contexts by leveraging both local and global information.

> While state-of-the-art models that rely upon massively multilingual pretrained encoders achieve sample efficiency in downstream applications, they still require abundant amounts of unlabelled text. Nevertheless, most of the world's languages lack such resources. Hence, we investigate a more radical form of unsupervised knowledge transfer in the absence of linguistic data. In particular, for the first time we pretrain neural networks via emergent communication from referential games. Our key assumption is that grounding communication on images---as a crude approximation of real-world environments---inductively biases the model towards learning natural languages. On the one hand, we show that this substantially benefits machine translation in few-shot settings. On the other hand, this also provides an extrinsic evaluation protocol to probe the properties of emergent languages ex vitro. Intuitively, the closer they are to natural languages, the higher the gains from pretraining on them should be. For instance, in this work we measure the influence of communication success and maximum sequence length on downstream performances. Finally, we introduce a customised adapter layer and annealing strategies for the regulariser of maximum-a-posteriori inference during fine-tuning. These turn out to be crucial to facilitate knowledge transfer and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Compared to a recurrent baseline, our method yields gains of 59.0%âˆ¼147.6% in BLEU score with only 500 NMT training instances and 65.1%âˆ¼196.7% with 1,000 NMT training instances across four language pairs. These proof-of-concept results reveal the potential of emergent communication pretraining for both natural language processing tasks in resource-poor settings and extrinsic evaluation of artificial languages.

> Current end-to-end approaches to Spoken Language Translation (SLT) rely on limited training resources, especially for multilingual settings. On the other hand, Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MultiNMT) approaches rely on higher quality and more massive data sets. Our proposed method extends a MultiNMT architecture based on language-specific encoders-decoders to the task of Multilingual SLT (MultiSLT) Our experiments on four different languages show that coupling the speech encoder to the MultiNMT architecture produces similar quality translations compared to a bilingual baseline (Â±0.2 BLEU) while effectively allowing for zero-shot MultiSLT. Additionally, we propose using Adapter networks for SLT that produce consistent improvements of +1 BLEU points in all tested languages.

> Contextual embeddings derived from transformer-based neural language models have shown state-of-the-art performance for various tasks such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and textual similarity in recent years. Extensive work shows how accurately such models can represent abstract, semantic information present in text. In this expository work, we explore a tangent direction and analyze such models' performance on tasks that require a more granular level of representation. We focus on the problem of textual similarity from two perspectives: matching documents on a granular level (requiring embeddings to capture fine-grained attributes in the text), and an abstract level (requiring embeddings to capture overall textual semantics). We empirically demonstrate, across two datasets from different domains, that despite high performance in abstract document matching as expected, contextual embeddings are consistently (and at times, vastly) outperformed by simple baselines like TF-IDF for more granular tasks. We then propose a simple but effective method to incorporate TF-IDF into models that use contextual embeddings, achieving relative improvements of up to 36% on granular tasks.

> Recent studies about learning multilingual representations have achieved significant performance gains across a wide range of downstream cross-lingual tasks. They train either an encoder-only Transformer mainly for understanding tasks, or an encoder-decoder Transformer specifically for generation tasks, ignoring the correlation between the two tasks and frameworks. In contrast, this paper presents a variable encoder-decoder (VECO) pre-training approach to unify the two mainstreams in both model architectures and pre-training tasks. VECO splits the standard Transformer block into several sub-modules trained with both inner-sequence and cross-sequence masked language modeling, and correspondingly reorganizes certain sub-modules for understanding and generation tasks during inference. Such a workflow not only ensures to train the most streamlined parameters necessary for two kinds of tasks, but also enables them to boost each other via sharing common sub-modules. As a result, VECO delivers new state-of-the-art results on various cross-lingual understanding tasks of the XTREME benchmark covering text classification, sequence labeling, question answering, and sentence retrieval. For generation tasks, VECO also outperforms all existing cross-lingual models and state-of-the-art Transformer variants on WMT14 English-to-German and English-to-French translation datasets, with gains of up to 1âˆ¼2 BLEU.

> Images can give us insights into the contextual meanings of words, but current image-text grounding approaches require detailed annotations. Such granular annotation is rare, expensive, and unavailable in most domain-specific contexts. In contrast, unlabeled multi-image, multi-sentence documents are abundant. Can lexical grounding be learned from such documents, even though they have significant lexical and visual overlap? Working with a case study dataset of real estate listings, we demonstrate the challenge of distinguishing highly correlated grounded terms, such as "kitchen" and "bedroom", and introduce metrics to assess this document similarity. We present a simple unsupervised clustering-based method that increases precision and recall beyond object detection and image tagging baselines when evaluated on labeled subsets of the dataset. The proposed method is particularly effective for local contextual meanings of a word, for example associating "granite" with countertops in the real estate dataset and with rocky landscapes in a Wikipedia dataset.
